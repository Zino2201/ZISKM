Welcome to the official documentation of the **Zino Instanced Skeletal Mesh** plugin for Unreal Engine.

The goal of the plugin is to provide easy skeletal mesh instancing allowing higher instance count, without headache of working with a custom system, since the plugin was built from the ground up to be used with Unreal's native systems, even though you can implement your own solution if needed !

The documentation is still in work in progress, feel free to contribute [here](https://github.com/Zino2201/ZISKM).
